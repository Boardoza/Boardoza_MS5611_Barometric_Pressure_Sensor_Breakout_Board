sentence=Library for Boardoza MS5611 Barometric Pressure Sensor
paragraph=This library provides an easy‑to‑use API for interfacing with the Boardoza MS5611 high‑precision barometric pressure sensor breakout. It handles all I²C communication, returns calibrated pressure (Pa), temperature (°C/°F), and altitude readings, and includes built‑in error checking and compensation algorithms. With minimal dependencies and clear example sketches, it’s designed to help you integrate the MS5611 quickly into any Arduino or PlatformIO project.
